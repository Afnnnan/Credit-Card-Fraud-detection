# Credit-Card-Fraud-detection

This notebook implements a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning. It includes data loading, preprocessing, and model training with techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The notebook also addresses class imbalance with SMOTE and evaluates models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure reliable detection of fraudulent transactions.
